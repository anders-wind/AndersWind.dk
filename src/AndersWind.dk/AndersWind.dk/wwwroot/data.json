      "Description": "In this project a group of me and 5 other students had to create a distributed implementation of the DCR graphs created at ITU by Thomas Hildebrandt. Furthermore a client had to be made, which should allow only certain roles to execute certain events. The architecture is based on a peer-to-peer system, where a central server is only used at graph initiation and when a client wants to access the graph. The solution is well tested and documented and SCRUM was used to manage the team over the course of the implementation.",
